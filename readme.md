# Awesome Non-Financial Blockchain [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> Curated list of projects that build non-financial applications of blockchain.

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value (by [Don Tapscott](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-generation-internet-surprise-its-all-don-tapscott)).

Most applications of blockchain lie in a financial realm. That makes non-financial applications even more intriguing.

Industry of a blockchain application is defined by the one that is changed the most. For example, discontinued IoT bitcoin micropayments startup [21](https://21.co) (now [Earn.com](https://earn.com)) could significantly change both IoT and Financial sectors. Financial industry would expand its _current_ practice to a new domain. For IoT, however, _business model_ would change significantly. That intuition commands current classification.
